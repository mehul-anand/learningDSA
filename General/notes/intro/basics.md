# Basics
- every problem is a 2 step probelm in DSA 
- The "approach" comes when you have solved enough problems
  
## Steps to solve a problem
- FInd the solution/approach
  - understand the probelm
  - come up with an approach
    - once that is there
    - try to optimize it
- Then write the code

## Mistakes
- only studying DSA for interviews
- no shortcuts
- make your notes and code

## DSA is tricky
- sometimes you won't understand the problem and it is okay
    - understand the thought process of the instructor and then mimic
    
    ### Spaced repetition
    - saw a problem
      - try it once
        - then after a week 
    ### Try random questions
